# ü©∫ Obesity Risk Prediction

## üìò Overview

This project predicts an individual's **risk of obesity** based on
demographic, dietary, and lifestyle factors using machine learning
models. It provides healthcare practitioners and researchers with
insights for prevention and awareness campaigns.

## üéØ Business Objective

To enable **early intervention** by identifying individuals at higher
risk of obesity, allowing targeted wellness and nutrition programs to
reduce obesity-related diseases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ü©∫ Obesity Risk Prediction

This repository presents a complete **Machine Learning and Business Intelligence project** designed to predict **obesity risk levels** based on lifestyle, diet, and physical activity data. It integrates **data analysis, model building, and Power BI dashboard visualization** for decision-making in healthcare analytics.

## üìä Project Overview

Obesity is a major public health issue globally, influenced by factors like eating habits, physical activity, and demographics.  
This project uses **machine learning models** to predict an individual‚Äôs obesity category and identifies key lifestyle patterns contributing to health risk.

**Goal:**  
Build an end-to-end data pipeline that predicts obesity risk levels, visualizes insights, and automates periodic reporting.
- Build a robust predictive model - Visualize lifestyle and
demographic correlations - Automate data collection, model training, and
reporting

## üß© Detailed Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define Business Problem

-   **Goal:** Predict individuals at high risk of obesity to enable
    early lifestyle intervention.\
-   **Stakeholders:** Healthcare providers, fitness companies, insurance
    firms, and nutrition planners.\
-   **Key Questions:**
    -   What demographic or lifestyle factors most contribute to obesity
        risk?
    -   How can predictive analytics help reduce healthcare costs?

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Extraction & Collection

-   **Sources:** Public health datasets, hospital records (CSV, SQL, or
    API-based sources).\
-   **Tools Used:**
    -   Python (`pandas`, `requests`) for API and CSV ingestion.\
    -   SQL queries to extract structured data from health databases.\
    -   Power Query or Power BI Dataflows for live data connections.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

-   Handle missing values using **mean/median imputation**.\
-   Remove or cap outliers in BMI, calorie intake, and physical activity
    using **IQR method**.\
-   Normalize categorical fields (e.g., diet type, activity level) using
    **OneHotEncoder**.\
-   Convert inconsistent units (e.g., height in meters vs.¬†cm).\
-   Ensure schema consistency across merged datasets.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

-   Derived features such as:
    -   **BMI = weight(kg) / (height(m))¬≤**
    -   **Calorie per activity ratio**
    -   **Lifestyle Index = (sleep_hours √ó activity_level) /
        screen_time**
-   Standardize features with **MinMaxScaler** or **StandardScaler**.\
-   Perform **correlation analysis** to identify predictive variables.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Train/Test Split

-   Split dataset into 70/30 or 80/20 ratios using `train_test_split`.\
-   Use **stratified sampling** if class imbalance exists.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training

-   Models used:
    -   Logistic Regression (baseline)
    -   Random Forest
    -   XGBoost (best-performing)
-   **Hyperparameter tuning:** GridSearchCV for optimized learning rate,
    depth, and estimators.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation

-   Metrics:
    -   **AUC-ROC Curve** for model discrimination
    -   **Precision-Recall Curve** for imbalanced data
    -   **Confusion Matrix** for misclassification insights
    -   **Feature Importance Graphs** for interpretability

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment

-   **Streamlit App:**\
    Simple web app where users input age, gender, diet, and lifestyle to
    get a predicted obesity risk score.
-   **Power BI Dashboard:**\
    Connects model outputs or datasets to visualize trends
    interactively.
-   **Flask API:**\
    Serve predictions for integration with mobile apps or EMR systems.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Automation

-   Schedule data refresh and model retraining using:
    -   **Airflow DAGs** (monthly model updates)
    -   **Cron Jobs** for nightly data ingestion and prediction logs\
    -   **Email alerts** for pipeline success/failure
